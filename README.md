## Comments
- First it took me a while to figure out how this would work. Then I spend a long time trying to implement my ideas. I nearly gave up along the way because it getting too hard but I persisted and eventually found the way out.

- Most of my trials to get the functionality working was based on "hard-coded" parameters. Once they worked fine, I generalized them with functions.

- This project was part of my Back End Engineer Career Path on Codecademy. I'm so happy I completed this porject successfully as I'm still a beginner developer.

- Feel free to get to do more with or suggest a new functionality that could make it better
